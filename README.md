Sign up form and log in forms have been added to master branch. They work with the MySQL database tables in sql/socialmedia.sql

Group members: make sure to update your current branches by pulling these master branch changes. I don't think any of my work should
                interfere with what you've got, so everything should go smoothly. Also, when you have a significant amount of work 
                done on your branch and you want to add that content to the master branch, let me know on Discord after some testing 
                has been done on it and I'll merge it and add it to the master branch. If you guys need any help with anything you may be 
                stuck on, let me know! I'm more than glad to help! We can work through Zoom or Discord, if need be. If you need someone to 
                discuss implemenation ideas for a story/feature or get a second opinion, I'm glad to help also!
